# Charity Engine Remote CLI

The Remote CLI provides a means to run jobs on
[Charity Engine](https://www.charityengine.com/marketplace) compute resources
using simple command line tools. It can be used as a standalone command
interface or via GNU Parallel (using Parallel allows you to manage batches of
work using just a single command line tool).
